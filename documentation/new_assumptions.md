Additional Assumptions:

For the initial calculation we assume theta to be a constant of 25 degrees across the span of the aileron.

We will do all the calculations in the local coordinate system, which is located in hinge 2. The deflections in axial directions of the local coordinate system will be the same as in the global coordinate system, because the local reference frame is fixed here.

However, due to the angle of twist between actuator 1 and hinge 2, the deflections will deviate an additional amount in the global reference frame.

The rotation about the x-axis is fixed at 25deg at actuator 1
